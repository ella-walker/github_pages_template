This is for my data acquisition blog where I will show you had to create a unique dataset and what information I gained from my unique dataset.

**Introduction**
Why is this project relevant and interesting? What is the motivating question? What do we hope to learn from this data?

**Summary of Steps**
1. overly detailed accounts are discouraged
2. Provide enough info to help someone else potentially get started with a similar project

**EDA Highlights**
* Summary statistics
* Summary graphics
* Information about final dataset (total sample size, counts of categorical variables, numerical summaries of numeric variables)
