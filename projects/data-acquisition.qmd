# Introduction

For this project I created my own dataset in which I used webscraping techniques to create a unique dataframe that I could explore. I chose to explore information on mass shootings in the United States so far in 2025. I was curious where shootings were centralized, how many people died or were injured in mass shootings, and if there were any common characteristics between these tragic events. 

I believe that if we can understand this data then we can better create policy and regulation which will serve the American people and promote peace and safety for everyone.

# Summary of Steps
1. I found a Wikipedia page which contained a table that had an up to date list of shootings in the United States. This table contained all the information I was interested in.
2. Using the BeautifulSoup library I downloaded the data and created my own table. This contained over 200 entries and 6 variables. One of the variables that I was unsure how to deal with was a written description of the data.
3. I explored the data in an EDA to better understand the variables and their relationships. In doing this I created some visualizations.
4. I looked for answers to my initial questions. I am happy to share my findings in the conclusion of this blog.

# EDA Highlights

- Summary statistics
- Summary graphics
- Information about final dataset (total sample size, counts of categorical variables, numerical summaries of numeric variables)

# Conclusion

Ultimately my findings revealed this information about mass shootings in the United States ____. I am curious how this information compares to previous years in American history, with a specific interest around major political or economic events. I am also curious how these results compare to other countries with a similar GDP and culture.
