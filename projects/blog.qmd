## Cleaning Messy Column Names in Seconds with Pandas

Messy columns can make your data difficult to understand and work with. Luckily, Python offers a very simple way to change your column names to better fit your dataset.

## Why is cleaning data important?

Data cleaning is one of the essential steps in the data science lifecycle. Data cleaning ensures accuracy, consistency, and completeness. Data cleaning will help identify and contain errors which will ultimately lead to reliable results.

Column names are an important part of a clean data set because they not only make the data clear for the analyst, but also improve data integrity for all potential users.

## How do I use pandas to make consistent column names?

There are several processes which are important to cleaning column names. 

Step 1: Remove leading and trailing whitespace

Step 2: Standardize formatting

Step 3: Remove special characters

Once you Have mastered these steps you can combine them for a simplified cleaning process.

# Step 1: Remove Leading and Trailing Whitespace

Sometimes datasets contain column names with extra spaces at the beginning or end. Since your analysis will require the column names to be exactly the same as it appears in your dataset, this can often lead to confusion and unecessary errors.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

books = pd.DataFrame({
    " Title ": ["Pride and Prejudice", "The Great Gatsby", "Wuthering Heights"],
    " Author ": ["Jane Austen", "F. Scott Fitzgerald", "Emily Bronte"],
    " Year ": [1813, 1925, 1847]
})

# Strip whitespace using pandas
books.columns = books.columns.str.strip()

books
```

# Step 2: Standardize Formatting

Column names are often inconsistent in formatting. Sometimes they have a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters and often they have spaces instead of underscores between words.

```{python}
cities = pd.DataFrame({
    "State": ["Utah", "Florida", "Connecticut"],
    "Capital City": ["Salt Lake City", "Tallahassee", "Hartford"],
    "Population in millions": [3.5, 23.4, 3.7]
})

cities.columns = cities.columns.str.lower().str.replace(" ", "_")

cities
```

# Step 3: Remove Special Characters

Special characters in your column names may cause problems in your data. To keep the data consistent and clean remove them.

```{python}
bakery = pd.DataFrame({
    "item": ["croissant", "muffin", "bagel"],
    "price ($)": [2.50, 1.75, 3.25],
    "quantity (#)": [7, 12, 8]
})

bakery.columns = bakery.columns.str.replace(r'[^a-zA-z0-9_]', '', regex=True)

bakery
```

## Putting it all Together

Now that you have learned several new skills you can combine them all into one simple function for quick and repeatable cleaning.

```{python}
movies = pd.DataFrame({
    " Title ": ["Superman", "Fantastic Four", "Dog Man"],
    " Box Office Amount in Millions $ ": [600, 519, 145]
})

def clean_columns(data):
    data.columns = (
        data.columns
        .str.strip()
        .str.lower()
        .str.replace(" ", "_")
        .str.replace(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9_]', '', regex=True)
    )
    return data

movies = clean_columns(movies)

movies
```

## Conclusion

Standardizing column names is super quick and repeatable with pandas. Using these strategies will help you succeed in your data analysis projects.
