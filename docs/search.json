    "text": "Why is cleaning data important?\nData cleaning is one of the essential steps in the data science lifecycle. Data cleaning ensures accuracy, consistency, and completeness. Data cleaning will help identify and contain errors which will ultimately lead to reliable results.\nColumn names are an important part of a clean data set because they not only make the data clear for the analyst, but also improve data integrity for all potential users.\n\n\n\nImage credit: Analytics Training Hub (https://analyticstraininghub.com/life-cycle-of-data-science/)",
