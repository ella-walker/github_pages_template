    "text": "Why is cleaning data important?\nData cleaning is one of the essential steps in the data science lifecycle, as pictured below. Before using a dataset you must clean it to ensure accuracy, consistency, and completeness. Dirty data can lead to the wrong conclusions, confusing bugs, and wasted time.\nColumn names may seem trivial but they are actually an important part of a clean data set because they not only make the data clear for the analyst, but also improve data integrity for all potential users.\n\n\n\nImage credit: Analytics Training Hub (https://analyticstraininghub.com/life-cycle-of-data-science/)\n\n\nBy investing a few minutes to clean your column names, you may be saving yourself hours in debugging and ensuring reliable results.",

By removing whitespace, standardizing formatting, and removing special chaaracters you can quickly make your dataset more readable and consistent, and less prone to errors.\nWith pandas, this process is repeatable and scalable, so you can apply it to any dataset in seconds.
